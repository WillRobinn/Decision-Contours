Here is code to reproduce decision contours in "Exploring Graphical Approaches to Assess the Impact of an Additional Trial on a Decision Model via Updated Meta-Analysis" [link to paper] and also to create your own.

As explained in the scripts, `Statistical Significance Contour Figure.R` is for generating contour regions that derive statistical significance contours as in Langan et al. "Graphical augmentations to the funnel plot assess the impact of additional evidence on a meta-analysis", and is what the decision contours are extended from. It was used to produce Figure 2.1 in the paper.

`Decision Contour Figures.R` contains an adapted version of the code to produce the rest of the figures in the paper. Although plots like Figure 4.5C do require some slight editing of the function (instructions in the script).
